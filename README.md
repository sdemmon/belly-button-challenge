# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes inhabiting human navels. The dataset provides insights into the prevalence of various microbial species in human navels, with some being more common than others. Using D3 library, the dashboard displays a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in each individual, along with a bubble chart illustrating each sample. Additionally, demographic information for each individual is displayed. The dashboard updates dynamically as users select different samples. This project aims to offer an engaging and informative way to explore the fascinating world of belly button microbiomes.
